Come principale obbiettivo ha quello di promuovere la figura dell’ingegnere dell’automazione, incentivando rapporti di collaborazione e condivisione di interessi tra gli studenti.","domande.cosafate":"Cosa fate?","domande.testocosafate.progetto":"Il nostro progetto è quello di creare una grande community di studenti disposti ad aiutarsi vicendevolmente al fine di rendere più entusiasmante il proprio percorso accademico.","domande.testocosafate.accrescimento":"Questo significa affiancare un accrescimento della propria conoscenza in abito ingegneristico ad un arricchimento personale e sociale. Per fare ciò organizzeremo eventi di diverse tipologie, sia più formali in collaborazione con aziende del settore o ex alunni, sia semplici meeting o aperitivi tra studenti nei quali ognuno potrà raccontare la propria esperienza universitaria (esami a scelta, Erasmus, stages...).","domande.testocosafate.pianostudi":"Sei ancora indeciso sulla scelta del piano di studi?!

The platform has since been used at several universities around the globe, including NCTU, Tsinghua, ETH, Université de Montréal and many others.  Now it is a worldwide initiative to realize a new vision for AI and robotics education. In 2018 the Duckietown Foundation, a non-profit foundation, was born, and its aim is to develops and promots the Duckietown project. The Duckietown Foundation also hosts the AI Driving Olympics (AI-DO) twice per year, at ICRA and NeurIPS. The AI-DO is a set of competition with the objective of evaluating the state of the art for ML/AI for embodied intelligence. We are looking for people interested in the world of autonomous driving, robotics and AI, in order to create a team capable of working with the Duckietown Platform and of facing challenges (like the next AIDO competiotion)! If you want to apply for the team, please fill the forms below. The whole project is already available on Github. The team will work in a Linux enviroment, using mainly technology like Python, ROS, Docker.","duckietown.whatistitolo":"What is Duckietown?","duckietown.whatis":"Duckietown started as a class at MIT in 2016 and all of the pieces of the experience (the slides, the demos, the platform, the software) were made openly available and other institutions began to take interest.
