Great! However,\nhave you ever wondered, which competencies really matter for your job entry?\nCareer paths are as individual as you are, so there cannot be a unique answer. Therefore, in this talk I will give you insights about my work experience as control engineer at Bosch Corporate Research and try to point out what I feel are helpful skills for my daily work.\nFirst, I will give you a short introduction about Bosch as world’s leading automotive supplier, and about the broad technological spectrum we cover at our Research division. Second, I will present a technical example from problem to solution in order to illustrate, which university courses helped me for successful problem solving\n<br/><br/>\nSPEAKER: Stefan Gering studied Electrical Engineering with focus on automation and control at Technical University of Darmstadt, where he received his diploma in 2012. He continued his studies at the Institute for Automatic Control and Mechatronics in Darmstadt and as visiting researcher at the European Centre for Soft Computing in Mieres (Spain). During his studies, he received scholarships from the “StudienstiftungdesdeutschenVolkes” and the “Deutsche Telekom Stiftung”. After having obtained his PhD.in 2015,he joined the control engineering group at Bosch’s Corporate Research. Since then, he worked on model predictive control for electric drive systems and control of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).\n<br/><br/>\nThe seminar is organized by the Automation and Control Engineering Degree Programme and primarily intended for students enrolled in the third year of the BSc Degree or in the MSc Degree. The seminar will be held in English. For information you can contact Prof. Lorenzo Fagiano (lorenzo.fagiano@polimi.it)\n<br/><br/>","testo_it":"WHEN: Wednesday, May 5th 2021, 14.00-15.00 (45’ seminar+15’ Q&A)\n<br/><br/>\n\nWHERE: https://politecnicomilano.webex.com/meet/lorenzo.fagiano\n<br/><br/>\nABSTRACT: You study control engineering and can write excellent exams?

The platform has since been used at several universities around the globe, including NCTU, Tsinghua, ETH, Université de Montréal and many others.  Now it is a worldwide initiative to realize a new vision for AI and robotics education. In 2018 the Duckietown Foundation, a non-profit foundation, was born, and its aim is to develops and promots the Duckietown project. The Duckietown Foundation also hosts the AI Driving Olympics (AI-DO) twice per year, at ICRA and NeurIPS. The AI-DO is a set of competition with the objective of evaluating the state of the art for ML/AI for embodied intelligence. We are looking for people interested in the world of autonomous driving, robotics and AI, in order to create a team capable of working with the Duckietown Platform and of facing challenges (like the next AIDO competiotion)! If you want to apply for the team, please fill the forms below. The whole project is already available on Github.
